# dev-connector v3
This is an update Brad Traversy's excellent course (https://github.com/bradtraversy/devconnector_2.0) on Udemy (now Coursera Specialization) on "MERN: Front To Back Full Stack React, Redux, and NodeJS". Some personal choices have been made (especially when multiple options for packages or frameworks is available, such as Vite) but for most part it is an update to standards, best practices and patterns as of 2025
Changes:
- Use async/await with try/catch instead of then/catch (promises)
- Use of import instead of require
- Use of Vite instead of create-react-app
